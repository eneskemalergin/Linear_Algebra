# Linear_Algebra

Linear Algebra is everwhere in our life. There are hundreds of technologies build upon linear algebra, such as; taking a photo with your phone, playing a video game, watching a movie with digital effects, searching from web, making a phone call, and so on... Linear algebra provides concepts that are crucial to many areas of computer science, including graphics, image processing, cryptography, machine learning, computer vision, optimization, graph algorithms, quantum computation, computational biology, information retrieval and web search. Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.

Both learning linear algebra concepts and doing more practice in Python and R will be in this repository.
